# Atlanta-Food-Finder

Originally created as a project for CS2340 at Georgia Tech.

Atlanta Food Finder was an application designed to help foodies in the Atlanta area find new cuisines and restuarants to visit. We utilized a scrum workflow to plan the project and see it to its completion.

Built using Django and Tailwind.
